### Stock-Price-Prediction

Sometimes rather than modelling the regression algorithm with the features provided, we could create our own features, combining one or more given features in an arithmetic or logical format. In this case, we used the previous day max and the least price of the stock to create features such as High_low change Percentage, the vulnerability of the stock, its variance, mean, standard deviation which can be used as valuable features for further analysis to model the required regression algorithm.

A few different classifiers and kernals have been used to model the algorithm to compare the results obtained. Also, it is always better to save the model, which conserves time/ computational cost over calculating the values each time before testing the desired constraints as shown in the code.

Both the codes uploaded are one and the same, with minor changes. 

The programs are well commented and self-evident. Incase of further doubts, feel free to contact me at tejastk.reddy@gmail.com
